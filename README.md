Overall comments on grading questions:

1) Does your site make the information easy to find?
    - Better than the original, but some things could still be easier.
    - I can't find how to email the BoE.
    - The Voter Registration and Absentee Application forms are mentioned but not linked.
    - I have to dig and do some math to find the registration/absentee deadlines in 2020.
    - I have to dig and do some math to find the early voting dates in 2020.

2) Are the pages reasonably structured with HTML?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - Election dates would be well suited for a table format.
    - The active-link highlighting in the navbar isn't always right, which is confusing.
    - Arguably the board members should be structured in lists rather than paragraphs in the sidebar.
    - Similarly, the qualifications for absentee voting also seem more like a list.

3) Are the pages tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - I find that font hard to read. It's usually best to use sans-serif fonts on the web.
    - All-caps is especially hard to read (on your calendar and early voting pages).
    - Buttons in the same menu should ideally be the same color (except for the active one).
    - Try to keep capitalization and text length consistent within a menu as well.
